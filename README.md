## Hi there, my name is Araceli ðŸ‘‹

I am a systems engineer. I graduated 6 years ago (August 2017) :tada::tada:

I have been working as a software developer for a little longer. I have worked with technologies like .Net and Angular in my beginnings and then later I also worked with Nodejs and React being these last ones the ones I liked the most. 

Since my first job I have worked with several frontend and backend technologies. I have gained a lot of experience and I am very grateful for that. But the time I spent working for companies and their projects left me little time to work on personal projects and be able to show my work and grow and improve in the technologies that really motivate and interest me. That's why I created this github profile, to allow me to do what I didn't do until then, play, learn, make mistakes but all this with the technologies and projects that I choose :muscle::raised_hands:

I also wanted to write a little bit about the other me that is not a developer. I'm from Argentina and I live in a beautiful city called Rosario. I like to exercise a lot, I currently play amateur soccer in a club in the city and I also do yoga. I have a beautiful four-legged daughter :cat2: who I named Ada, in honor of Ada Lovelace :bouquet:

I am very excited about this, about discovering and dedicating time to what I truly love :heartbeat:
